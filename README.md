`lib` is the start of a lean JS library for Google's [Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) <br>
`app/server.js` exposes an API and serves a website from `app/public` <br>
The frontend is a single page app whose purpose is to provide a delightful user experience and API gate. Additionally, because Google charges per use, this service will require monetization in the future.

### The path to 1.0

includes features like:
 * handling multi-face detection
 * auth implementation
 * clear site instructions/ documentation
 * payments setup in advance of pay per use/ subscription service
 * image file uploading and in-place capture

Stretch goals (2.0 and beyond):
 * more thoughtful design and animations
 * page routing in the app
 * more feature detections
 * user profiles
 * payment system
 * extract and open source standalone JS library
